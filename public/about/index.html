üåü Tech Journey

Backend &amp; Frontend Development

Full-Stack Expertise: Over the years, I&rsquo;ve honed my skills in building robust and scalable web applications. From crafting efficient APIs to designing engaging user interfaces, I thrive on creating seamless and dynamic user experiences.
Tech Stack: My go-to tools include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for frontend, and Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails for backend. I&rsquo;m also proficient in working with SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
Innovative Solutions: I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for new technologies and creative solutions to improve performance and scalability.

Cybersecurity

Learning and Growing: Cybersecurity isn&rsquo;t just a career path for me; it&rsquo;s a passion. I immerse myself in learning the latest techniques, methodologies, and concepts to stay ahead in the field.
Hands-On Practice: Regularly tackling machines on platforms like Hack The Box (HTB), VulnHub, and TryHackMe keeps my skills sharp. It&rsquo;s a thrilling challenge to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
